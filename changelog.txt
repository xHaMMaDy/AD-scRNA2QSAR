## QSARify Platform Update: Version&nbsp;2.0 â€“ **The&nbsp;Full&nbsp;Bench**

Welcome to the largest update to **QSARify** yet! Weâ€™ve officially launched the QSARify platform, an endâ€‘toâ€‘end suite of tools for cheminformatics. This public release introduces our three core applications, a complete visual overhaul, and a robust architecture to accelerate your research from data collection to deployment.

## Major New Features: The QSARify Application Suite

### Data Collection&nbsp;[ðŸ”¬]

- **LiveÂ Querying** â€” Fetch bioactivity data for any protein target using its **UniProtâ€¯ID**.
- **Interactiveâ€¯Visualizations** â€” Automatically generate plots for **Activityâ€¯Distribution (pIC50)**, **Drugâ€‘likeness**, and **Molecularâ€¯Weightâ€¯vs.â€¯LogP**.
- **Dataâ€¯Exploration** â€” View and sort the complete, processed dataset in a detailed table and export your results to CSV.

### Model Bench&nbsp;[ðŸ§ª]

- **Dataâ€¯Upload** â€” Upload one or more datasets in **.csv** or **.xlsx** format.
- **Featureâ€¯Engineering** â€” Interactively configure feature generation, including molecular fingerprints, physicochemical descriptors, and oneâ€‘hot encoding.
- **Modelâ€¯Training** â€” Select from a wide array of machineâ€‘learning models (from *Logisticâ€¯Regression* to *XGBoost*) and configure their hyperâ€‘parameters.
- **EvaluationÂ &Â Comparison** â€” Train multiple models at once and compare them sideâ€‘byâ€‘side with detailed reports, confusion matrices, and overlayed ROC curves.
- **Hyperâ€‘parameterâ€¯Tuning** â€” Run automated **GridSearchCV** to find the optimal parameters for your selected model.
- **Export** â€” Download fully trained models as **.pkl** files and receive detailed HTML performance reports.

### Model Playground&nbsp;[ðŸ§ ]

- **UploadÂ &Â Predict** â€” Upload any **.pkl** model file generated from the *Model Bench* (or your own pipeline) to start making predictions immediately.
- **Dynamicâ€¯Featureâ€¯Detection** â€” The playground intelligently inspects your uploaded model and creates UI elements (such as dropdowns) when specific inputs are required (e.g., protein targets).
- **SingleÂ &Â Batchâ€¯Modes** â€” Test your model on individual SMILES strings or in large batches.

## General UI/UX Enhancements

- **Unifiedâ€¯Platformâ€¯Design** â€” All tools share a cohesive, futuristic dark theme with a consistent *glassâ€‘card* style and a new animated background.
- **Newâ€¯Navigationâ€¯Header** â€” A fixed header provides quick access to all applications, plus links to the GitHub repository and this changelog.
- **Interactiveâ€¯Changelog** â€” A new modal fetches the latest updates directly from GitHub.
- **Mobileâ€¯Responsiveâ€¯Improvements** â€” Enhanced navigation and layout for smaller screens, including a functional mobile menu.
- **Customâ€¯404â€¯Page** â€” A polished page that matches the new theme and automatically redirects users to the main site.

## Backend & Architectural Improvements

- **Fullyâ€¯Integratedâ€¯Flaskâ€¯Backend** â€” A single, robust **Python** backend (`app.py`) now serves all applications and APIs.
- **Robustâ€¯Trainingâ€¯Pipeline** â€” Handles everything from data processing and feature generation to concurrent model training and hyperâ€‘parameter tuning.
- **Statefulâ€¯Trainingâ€¯Workflow** â€” *Model Bench* uses serverâ€‘side session management to maintain your progress through the entire modelâ€‘building pipeline.
- **Modularâ€¯Predictionâ€¯Engine** â€” The prediction endpoint in *Model Playground* can load arbitrary userâ€‘uploaded models and adapt dynamically to their feature requirements.
