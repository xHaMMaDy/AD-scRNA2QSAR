# QSARify Platform Update: Version 2.0 – **The Full Bench**

Welcome to the largest update to **QSARify** yet! We’ve officially launched the QSARify platform, an end‑to‑end suite of tools for cheminformatics. This public release introduces our three core applications, a complete visual overhaul, and a robust architecture to accelerate your research from data collection to deployment.

## Major New Features: The QSARify Application Suite

### Data Collection [🔬]

- **Live Querying** — Fetch bioactivity data for any protein target using its **UniProt ID**.
- **Interactive Visualizations** — Automatically generate plots for **Activity Distribution (pIC50)**, **Drug‑likeness**, and **Molecular Weight vs. LogP**.
- **Data Exploration** — View and sort the complete, processed dataset in a detailed table and export your results to CSV.

### Model Bench [🧪]

- **Data Upload** — Upload one or more datasets in **.csv** or **.xlsx** format.
- **Feature Engineering** — Interactively configure feature generation, including molecular fingerprints, physicochemical descriptors, and one‑hot encoding.
- **Model Training** — Select from a wide array of machine‑learning models (from *Logistic Regression* to *XGBoost*) and configure their hyper‑parameters.
- **Evaluation & Comparison** — Train multiple models at once and compare them side‑by‑side with detailed reports, confusion matrices, and overlayed ROC curves.
- **Hyper‑parameter Tuning** — Run automated **GridSearchCV** to find the optimal parameters for your selected model.
- **Export** — Download fully trained models as **.pkl** files and receive detailed HTML performance reports.

### Model Playground [🧠]

- **Upload & Predict** — Upload any **.pkl** model file generated from the *Model Bench* (or your own pipeline) to start making predictions immediately.
- **Dynamic Feature Detection** — The playground intelligently inspects your uploaded model and creates UI elements (such as dropdowns) when specific inputs are required (e.g., protein targets).
- **Single & Batch Modes** — Test your model on individual SMILES strings or in large batches.

## General UI/UX Enhancements

- **Unified Platform Design** — All tools share a cohesive, futuristic dark theme with a consistent *glass‑card* style and a new animated background.
- **New Navigation Header** — A fixed header provides quick access to all applications, plus links to the GitHub repository and this changelog.
- **Interactive Changelog** — A new modal fetches the latest updates directly from GitHub.
- **Mobile Responsive Improvements** — Enhanced navigation and layout for smaller screens, including a functional mobile menu.
- **Custom 404 Page** — A polished page that matches the new theme and automatically redirects users to the main site.

## Backend & Architectural Improvements

- **Fully Integrated Flask Backend** — A single, robust **Python** backend (`app.py`) now serves all applications and APIs.
- **Robust Training Pipeline** — Handles everything from data processing and feature generation to concurrent model training and hyper‑parameter tuning.
- **Stateful Training Workflow** — *Model Bench* uses server‑side session management to maintain your progress through the entire model‑building pipeline.
- **Modular Prediction Engine** — The prediction endpoint in *Model Playground* can load arbitrary user‑uploaded models and adapt dynamically to their feature requirements.
